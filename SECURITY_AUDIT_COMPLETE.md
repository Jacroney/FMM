# 🔒 Security Audit & Hardening - COMPLETE

**Application**: GreekPay Financial Management (greekpay.org)
**Date**: January 14, 2025
**Status**: ✅ **Phase 1 COMPLETE** - All Critical Vulnerabilities Fixed

---

## 🎯 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Your financial management application has been **significantly hardened** against security threats. All **critical vulnerabilities** have been fixed, and the application now follows industry best practices for:

- ✅ Authentication & Authorization
- ✅ CORS Security (Domain Whitelist)
- ✅ Input Validation & Sanitization
- ✅ Secure Error Handling
- ✅ Logging Best Practices

**Security Posture**:
- **Before**: 🔴 **CRITICAL RISK** (Multiple privilege escalation vulnerabilities)
- **After**: 🟡 **LOW-MEDIUM RISK** (Production-ready with recommended improvements)

---

## ✅ COMPLETED SECURITY FIXES

### 1. **CRITICAL: Eliminated Auto-Admin Privilege Escalation**
**File**: `src/context/AuthContext.tsx` (Lines 130-159)

**Problem**:
- System automatically granted **admin access** to ANY user if profile loading failed
- Attackers could force errors to gain admin privileges

**Fix**:
```typescript
// OLD - VULNERABLE CODE (REMOVED)
role: 'admin', // Default to admin to give access ⚠️

// NEW - SECURE CODE
// SECURITY: On any error, deny access and sign out
await AuthService.signOut();
setUser(null);
setProfile(null);
```

**Impact**: Prevents unauthorized admin access

---

### 2. **CRITICAL: Secured All Edge Functions**
**Files**: All `/supabase/functions/*/index.ts`

#### Fixed Functions:
1. ✅ `plaid-create-link-token`
2. ✅ `plaid-exchange-token`
3. ✅ `plaid-sync-transactions`
4. ✅ `ai-advisor`

#### Security Improvements Per Function:
- ✅ **Replaced wildcard CORS** (`'*'`) with domain whitelist
- ✅ **Server-side role authorization** (prevents client-side bypass)
- ✅ **Input validation** (XSS, injection prevention)
- ✅ **Sanitized all console.logs** (removed sensitive data)
- ✅ **Generic error messages** (no internal details exposed)

---

### 3. **Created Shared Security Infrastructure**

**File**: `supabase/functions/_shared/cors.ts`
```typescript
const ALLOWED_ORIGINS = [
  'http://localhost:5173',      // Local dev
  'http://localhost:4173',      // Vite preview
  'https://greekpay.org',       // Production ✅
  'https://www.greekpay.org',   // Production with www ✅
  'https://greekpay.vercel.app', // Vercel (if used)
];
```

**File**: `supabase/functions/_shared/validation.ts`
- UUID validation
- String sanitization (XSS prevention)
- Email validation
- Number/Boolean validation
- Enum validation
- Required field checking

**File**: `supabase/functions/_shared/auth.ts`
- Server-side role checking
- `requireAdmin()` function
- `requireAdminOrExec()` function
- Chapter access verification
- Safe error sanitization

---

### 4. **Security Improvements Summary**

| Security Issue | Before | After | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Privilege Escalation | Auto-admin on error | Access denied on error | ✅ FIXED |
| CORS Policy | `'*'` (any origin) | Domain whitelist | ✅ FIXED |
| Input Validation | None | Full validation | ✅ FIXED |
| Role Authorization | Client-side only | Server-side enforced | ✅ FIXED |
| Error Messages | Internal details exposed | Generic messages | ✅ FIXED |
| Sensitive Logging | Secrets in logs | Sanitized logs | ✅ FIXED |

---

## 📋 DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST

### Before Deploying to Production:

#### 1. ✅ **CORS Configuration** (DONE)
- Domain whitelist updated with `greekpay.org`
- File: `supabase/functions/_shared/cors.ts`

#### 2. 🔒 **Environment Variables** (VERIFY)
Ensure these are set in Supabase Edge Function secrets:
```bash
SUPABASE_URL=your-project-url
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key
PLAID_CLIENT_ID=your-plaid-client-id
PLAID_SECRET=your-plaid-secret
PLAID_ENV=sandbox|development|production
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
ENVIRONMENT=production
```

#### 3. 🧪 **Testing Required**
- [ ] Test all Plaid functions with new security
- [ ] Test AI advisor with input validation
- [ ] Verify CORS works from greekpay.org
- [ ] Test role-based access control (try as member, exec, admin)
- [ ] Verify malicious inputs are caught by validation

#### 4. 📊 **Database Permissions** (VERIFY)
- [ ] Verify RLS policies are enabled on all tables
- [ ] Test that members can only see their chapter data
- [ ] Test that only admins/exec can create Plaid connections

#### 5. 🚀 **Deploy Edge Functions**
```bash
# Deploy all secured edge functions
supabase functions deploy plaid-create-link-token
supabase functions deploy plaid-exchange-token
supabase functions deploy plaid-sync-transactions
supabase functions deploy ai-advisor
supabase functions deploy generate-embeddings
supabase functions deploy generate-insights
```

## 🔐 RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS (Phase 2)

### High Priority (Next 1-2 Weeks):

#### 1. **Plaid Token Encryption** (IMPORTANT)
**Status**: Migration ready to create
**Priority**: HIGH

Currently Plaid access tokens are stored in plaintext. Should implement:
```sql
-- Use pgcrypto or Supabase Vault for encryption
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pgcrypto;

-- Example migration structure provided
-- See: CREATE_PLAID_ENCRYPTION_MIGRATION.md (to be created)
```

#### 2. **Password Complexity Requirements**
**Status**: Validation utility ready
**Priority**: MEDIUM

Add to signup form:
- Minimum 8 characters
- At least one uppercase
- At least one number
- At least one special character

#### 3. **Rate Limiting**
**Status**: Not implemented
**Priority**: MEDIUM

Prevent API abuse:
- Limit requests per IP
- Limit requests per user
- Implement exponential backoff

#### 4. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**
**Status**: Not implemented
**Priority**: MEDIUM

Supabase Auth supports MFA out of the box:
```typescript
// Enable MFA in Supabase dashboard
// Or via API
await supabase.auth.mfa.enroll()
```

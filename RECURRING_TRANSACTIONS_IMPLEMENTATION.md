## 📋 What Was Built

### 1. Database Layer (SQL)

#### **Migration File**: `supabase/migrations/20250108000001_recurring_transactions.sql`

  - Supports daily, weekly, biweekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly frequencies
  - Auto-post capability for automatic transaction creation
  - Links to budget categories and periods
  - Row Level Security (RLS) enabled for chapter isolation

- ✅ `automation_audit` - Logs all automation runs
  - Tracks processed, inserted, updated, and errored records
  - Stores error messages for debugging
  - RLS enabled for chapter isolation

**Views Created:**
- ✅ `forecast_balance_view` - Projects future balance
  - Combines actual historical transactions (last 30 days)

## 🚀 How to Use

### Step 1: Deploy Database Migration

Run the migration in Supabase SQL Editor or via CLI:

```bash
supabase db push
```

Or manually execute:
```bash
psql -h your-project.supabase.co -U postgres -d postgres -f supabase/migrations/20250108000001_recurring_transactions.sql
```

---

### Step 2: Deploy Edge Function (Optional for Automation)

Deploy the recurring transaction processor:

```bash
supabase functions deploy process-recurring
```

Set up a cron job or scheduled trigger to call this function daily at 2 AM:
- Use Supabase's pg_cron extension
- Or use an external cron service (e.g., GitHub Actions, cron-job.org)

**Manual trigger endpoint:**
```
POST https://your-project.supabase.co/functions/v1/process-recurring
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ANON_KEY
```

---

### Step 3: Start Using the Feature

1. **Navigate to Recurring Transactions page** (`/recurring`)
2. **Click "Add Recurring"** to create a new recurring transaction
3. **Fill in the form:**
   - Name: e.g., "Monthly Rent"
   - Amount: e.g., -1500 (negative for expenses)
   - Frequency: Monthly
   - Next due date: First of next month
   - Category: Select appropriate category
   - Enable "Auto-post" if you want automatic creation

4. **Save** and the recurring transaction will appear in the table

5. **View the forecast** on the Dashboard
   - The Cash Flow Forecast card will now show projected balance
   - It includes your recurring transactions in the projection

6. **Process manually** if needed:
   - Click "Process Now" on the Recurring page
   - This creates actual expense records for any due recurring items

## 📊 Data Flow

```
User Creates Recurring Transaction
         ↓
Stored in recurring_transactions table
         ↓
Daily at 2 AM (or manual trigger)
         ↓
process_recurring_transactions() function runs
         ↓
For each due transaction (auto_post = true):
  - Creates expense record in expenses table
  - Updates next_due_date
  - Logs to automation_audit
         ↓
Forecast view combines:
  - Historical expenses (actual)
  - Upcoming recurring (projected)
         ↓
Dashboard displays forecast chart
```

## ✨ Summary

You now have a complete recurring transactions and cash flow forecasting system that:

1. **Automates repetitive transactions** - Set it and forget it
2. **Predicts future cash flow** - See what's coming 90 days ahead
3. **Warns of problems** - Alerts when balance will go negative
4. **Integrates seamlessly** - Works with existing budgets and categories
5. **Looks great** - Beautiful charts and clean UI

This makes your app **significantly more powerful than Excel** by automating what would be manual formula updates and providing visual forecasting that Excel requires complex setup to achieve.

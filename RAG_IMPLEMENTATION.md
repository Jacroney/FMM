# Phase 2: RAG Implementation - Complete! 🎉

## What's New

Your AI advisor now has **full context awareness** of your financial data through RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation). It can now answer questions using your **real transactions, budgets, spending patterns, and more**.

## How It Works

### 1. Embedding Generation
When you initialize the knowledge base, the system:
- Converts all your financial data into semantic embeddings (1536-dimensional vectors)
- Stores these in the `ai_knowledge_base` table with pgvector
- Indexes transactions, budgets, recurring items, spending patterns, and dues status

### 2. Intelligent Retrieval
When you ask a question:
1. Your question is converted to an embedding
2. Vector similarity search finds the 8 most relevant pieces of context
3. Real-time data is fetched (current budgets, recent transactions, bank balance)
4. All context is assembled and injected into the AI prompt

### 3. Context-Aware Responses
The AI now has access to:
- Your actual transaction history
- Current budget status with spending percentages
- Spending patterns by category
- Recurring transaction schedules
- Dues collection status
- Real-time bank balance from Plaid

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Initialize Knowledge Base

1. Navigate to **AI Advisor** in the sidebar
2. Click the **Database icon** (top right of sidebar)
3. Click **"Initialize Now"**
4. Wait for embeddings to be generated (~30-60 seconds for typical data)

You should see:
```
✓ Knowledge base updated! 150+ embeddings created.
```

### Step 2: Verify Knowledge Base

After initialization, the Knowledge Base panel should show:
```
Total Items: 156
  transaction: 50
  budget: 12
  recurring: 5
  insight: 89
Updated: 1/13/2025
```

### Step 3: Start Asking Questions!

The AI can now answer context-aware questions about your actual financial data.

## Test Questions

Try these to see RAG in action:

### Budget Questions
```
"How much of our budget have we used?"
→ Gets actual budget status with percentages

"Are we over budget in any categories?"
→ Identifies specific over-budget categories with amounts

"Which category has the most remaining budget?"
→ Compares all categories and ranks them
```

### Transaction Analysis
```
"What did we spend on food this month?"
→ Returns actual amount from transactions

"What's our biggest expense in the last 30 days?"
→ Finds and explains the largest transaction

"Show me all transactions over $500"
→ Lists specific transactions with details
```

### Pattern Discovery
```
"What are our most frequent expenses?"
→ Identifies spending patterns automatically

"How much do we typically spend on events?"
→ Calculates averages from historical data

"Are there any unusual charges?"
→ Detects anomalies in spending
```

### Forecasting
```
"What recurring expenses are coming up?"
→ Lists scheduled recurring transactions

"Will we run out of money this month?"
→ Projects cash flow based on data

"What's our projected balance in 30 days?"
→ Uses recurring items + trends to forecast
```

### Comparisons
```
"How does this month compare to last month?"
→ Compares spending across periods

"Which category increased the most?"
→ Identifies largest growth areas

"Are we spending more on food than usual?"
→ Compares to historical averages
```

### Bank & Dues
```
"What's our current bank balance?"
→ Shows real-time Plaid data

"How many members haven't paid dues?"
→ Gets actual dues status

"What's our dues collection rate?"
→ Calculates percentage from member_dues
```

## Expected Responses

### Without RAG (Phase 1):
**Q:** "How much have we spent on events?"
**A:** "I can help you track event expenses. You should look at your Event Expenses category in your budget and check the transactions..."

### With RAG (Phase 2):
**Q:** "How much have we spent on events?"
**A:** "You've spent $3,847 on Event Expenses this quarter, which is 77% of your $5,000 budget. Your recent event transactions include:
- Oct 15: DJ service $800
- Oct 10: Venue rental $1,500
- Oct 5: Catering $1,200

You have $1,153 remaining in your event budget."

## Knowledge Base Management

### When to Refresh
- After importing large batches of transactions
- After creating/updating budgets
- After adding recurring transactions
- Monthly as a best practice

### How to Refresh
1. Click the Database icon in AI Advisor
2. Click the Refresh icon (↻) in the Knowledge Base panel
3. Wait for embeddings to regenerate

### What Gets Embedded

1. **Transactions** (up to 500 most recent):
   - Description, amount, date
   - Category, payment method, source
   - Vendor information

2. **Budgets** (all active):
   - Allocated amount, spent, remaining
   - Percentage used, period info
   - Over/under budget status

3. **Recurring Items** (all active):
   - Name, amount, frequency
   - Next due date, category
   - Auto-post status

4. **Spending Patterns** (90-day aggregates):
   - Total spent by category
   - Transaction counts
   - Monthly averages

5. **Dues Status** (current period):
   - Total members, payment rate
   - Expected vs. collected amounts
   - Overdue counts, late fees

## Architecture

```
User Question: "How much did we spend on food?"
      ↓
1. Generate Query Embedding (OpenAI ada-002)
      ↓
2. Vector Search (pgvector cosine similarity)
      ↓
3. Retrieve Top 8 Relevant Items from ai_knowledge_base
      ↓
4. Fetch Real-Time Data (budgets, transactions, bank balance)
      ↓
5. Assemble Context (200-500 tokens of relevant data)
      ↓
6. Enhanced System Prompt with Context
      ↓
7. Call GPT-3.5-turbo with Rich Context
      ↓
8. Context-Aware Response

## Cost Analysis

### Embedding Generation
- **One-time**: ~$0.05 for 500 transactions
- **Updates**: ~$0.01/month for new data
- **Total**: <$1/semester

### Chat with RAG
- **Per query**: ~$0.002 (same as before, context adds minimal tokens)
- **Monthly**: $2-3 for typical usage

### Total Cost: ~$3-4/semester
*vs. hiring a financial consultant: $50-100/hour*

## Technical Details

### Vector Search Function
```sql
search_knowledge_base(
  p_chapter_id UUID,
  p_embedding vector(1536),
  p_content_types TEXT[],
  p_limit INTEGER
) RETURNS TABLE (...)
```

Uses HNSW index for fast similarity search (< 10ms for 1000+ embeddings).

### Context Assembly
- **Max context size**: ~2000 tokens
- **Real-time data**: Always fresh (direct DB queries)
- **Vector search**: Top 8 most relevant items
- **Metadata tracking**: Records what context was used per message

### Metadata Stored
Each AI response stores:
```json
{
  "retrieved_items": 8,
  "context_types": ["transaction", "budget", "insight"],
  "bank_balance": 12450.75,
  "budgets_included": 5,
  "transactions_included": 10
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "No knowledge base found"
**Solution:** Click "Initialize Now" to generate embeddings

### Issue: AI gives generic answers
**Possible causes:**
1. Knowledge base not initialized → Initialize it
2. No relevant data → Add transactions/budgets first
3. Question too vague → Be more specific

### Issue: Slow responses
**Expected:** First query takes 2-3 seconds (embedding generation + retrieval + LLM)
**If slower:** Check Supabase function logs for errors

### Issue: Embeddings fail to generate
**Check:**
1. OpenAI API key is set in Supabase secrets
2. You have transaction/budget data in the database
3. Function logs: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/ffgeptjhhhifuuhjlsow/logs/edge-functions?s=generate-embeddings

## Example Session

```
You: "Initialize knowledge base"
AI: ✓ Knowledge base updated! 156 embeddings created.

You: "What's our financial status?"
AI: "Your chapter is in good financial health:

Current Bank Balance: $12,450.75 (from USAA)

Budget Status (Q4 2024):
- Event Expenses: $3,847 of $5,000 (77%) ✓
